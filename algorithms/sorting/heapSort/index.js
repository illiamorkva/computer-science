/**
 * Heap Sort is an in-place algorithm.
 * Its typical implementation is Not Stable, but can be made stable.
 * 
 * Time Complexity.
 * Best
 * O(N * log N)
 * Average
 * O(N * log N)
 * Worst
 * O(N * log N)
 * 
 * Time complexity of heapify is O(log N).
 * Time complexity of building a heap is O(N) and
 * overall time complexity of Heap Sort is O(N * log N).
 * 
 * Space Complexity.
 * O(1),
 * but practically very slow due to cache-inefficiency.
 * 
 * Heap Sort algorithm has limited uses because Quick Sort and
 * Merge Sort are better in practice.
