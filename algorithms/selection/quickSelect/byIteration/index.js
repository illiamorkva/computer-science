/**
 * This function returns k'th smallest element in arr[l..r] using QuickSort.
 * 
 * The algorithm is similar to QuickSort. The difference is, instead of recurring
 * for both sides (after finding pivot), it recurs only for the part that contains
 * the k-th smallest element.
 * This reduces the expected complexity from O(N * log N) to O(N), with a worst case of O(N^2).
 * 
 * Important Points:
 * - Like QuickSort, it is fast in practice, but has poor worst-case performance.
 * - The partition process is same as QuickSort, only recursive code differs.
 * - There exists an algorithm that finds k-th smallest element in O(N) in worst case,
 * but QuickSelect performs better on average.
 * 
 * Time Complexity.
 * The quickselect has good average performance, but is sensitive to the pivot that is chosen.
 * If good pivots are chosen, meaning ones that consistently decrease the search set by a given fraction,
 * then the search set decreases in size exponentially and by induction one sees that performance is linear - O(N),
 * as each step is linear.
 * However, if bad pivots are consistently chosen, such as decreasing by only a single element each time,
 * then worst-case performance is quadratic - O(N^2).
 * 
 * Space Complexity.
 * It is also an in-place algorithm, requiring only constant memory overhead
 * if tail call optimization is available, or if eliminating the tail recursion with a loop.
 *
