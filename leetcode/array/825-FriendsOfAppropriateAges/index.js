/**
825. Friends Of Appropriate Ages
https://leetcode.com/problems/friends-of-appropriate-ages/description/

Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and ages[i] is the age of the ith person. 

Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:

age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7
age[B] > age[A]
age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100
Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?

Example 1:

Input: [16,16]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.

Example 2:

Input: [16,17,18]
Output: 2
Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.

Example 3:

Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
Output: 
Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.

Notes:

1 <= ages.length <= 20000.
1 <= ages[i] <= 120.
